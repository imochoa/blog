I find it increasingly difficult to keep up with all of my hobbies.
So I decided to take up another hobby (starting this blog) to keep track of my other hobbies.

The things I like and will probably write about are: maths, programming, music and bad puns
(as you may have guessed the title of the blog ðŸ‘€).

If you'd like to buy me a coffee, feel free. My PayPal's at the bottom of the page
and god knows I could use some right about now â˜•.
